# Baking App

## Project Overview
You will productionize an app, taking it from a functional state to a production-ready state.
This will involve finding and handling error cases, adding accessibility features, allowing for
localization, adding a widget, and adding a library.

## Why this Project?
As a working Android developer, you often have to create and implement apps where you are 
responsible for designing and planning the steps you need to take to create a production-ready app.
Unlike Popular Movies where we gave you an implementation guide, it will be up to you to figure things 
out for the Baking App.

## What I Learned

* Use MediaPlayer/Exoplayer to display videos.
* Handle error cases in Android.
* Add a widget to your app experience.
* Leverage a third-party library in your app.
* Use Fragments to create a responsive design that works on phones and tablets.

## App Description
Your task is to create a Android Baking App that will allow Udacityâ€™s resident baker-in-chief, Miriam,
to share her recipes with the world. You will create an app that will allow a user to select a recipe 
and see video-guided steps for how to complete it.
